"The Basilica dell'Immacolata, identified as the Church of San Francesco "
"d'Assisi, with the adjoining Convent, was founded by the Franciscan Friars "
"Minor who had settled in Sicily in the 13th century and, particularly in "
"Agrigento, since 1295. The plan of the Church is rectangular, with a single "
"nave without transept, with seven side altars; The walls and the ceiling "
"were frescoed by the painter Lucio Gurreri, who depicted, on the vault of "
"the apse, among the saints, in a crowded heavenly image, the figures of "
"Mons. Michele Sclafani and Bishop Mons. Giovanni Battista Peruzzo, who "
"wanted to be buried in the same church. The first construction is of "
"Chiaramonte origin, as confirmed by the testament of Donna Isabella "
"Chiaramonte of December 6, 1362, in which she ordered her heirs to erect a "
"tomb for her, upon her death, in that 'Tribuna nova ecclesiae conventus San "
"Francisci', built by Federico Chiaramonte. In 1788, a new bell tower was "
"added, and after the bombings of 1943, Mons. Michele Sclafani, rector of the "
"Basilica, promptly intervened to restore the monument, both externally and "
"internally, by reproducing the paintings and decorations. A plaque on the "
"perimeter wall recalls that on July 12, 1943, an Allied bomber hit the "
"shelter in Via San Francesco, causing 340 victims. The basilica today is in "
"excellent condition with its magnificent facade in sandstone tuff, flanked "
"by two bell towers. In the center at the bottom is an elegant portal between "
"Ionic pilasters and Gothic and local decorative elements, precisely "
"Chiaramonte, while at the top is the niche containing the statue of Saint "
"Francis, in white marble."

" The 'Granella House,' or more accurately Palazzo Quartana, takes its name "
"from the wealthy and hated moneylender from Trapani, Pietro Quartana. It has "
"remained intact, almost as described by Luigi Pirandello in his novella; "
"austere and solitary, not only because of its location but also due to the "
"fact that Quartana's wife was thrown out of the house after being discovered "
"as the lover of Nicolò Gallo. This episode inspired Luigi Pirandello to "
"write 'L’esclusa.' Even today, the shutters are always closed and it remains "
"uninhabited, except for about 40 years ago when it was used as an elementary "
"school (it is said that the school had a short life due to ghosts! This "
"explains why it is still uninhabited today). The literary description in the "
"novella is a felicitous portrayal of the house, the square, and the "
"neighborhood from a geographical and sociological perspective. The house was "
"built at the highest and most solitary point, outside Porta Bibirria. The "
"facade is characterized by beautiful arches, more or less visible within the "
"frame of the ground floor commercial activities. There is also a liturgical "
"center selling religious items, which recently replaced a pub called "
"'Museum.' Historian Beniamino Biodi, after interviewing the neighborhood "
"residents, confirmed the hypothesis that the house is still considered "
"haunted. The 19th-century architecture of Palazzo Quartana, built by "
"Basile's student Dionisio Sciascia, the architect of the theaters in "
"Agrigento and Racalmuto, is simple. In front of the 'Granella House' is now "
"the 'Belvedere Don Bosco,' from where one can admire the Agrigento "
"hinterland from Raffadali to Cammarata. From Piazza Bibirria, heading west, "
"you reach Via Duomo with the Cathedral, the Seminary, the Curia, the "
"Bishop's Palace, and the Diocesan Museum. To the south, Via BacBac (the "
"dwarf's street) leads to Piano Lena and Piazza della Riconoscenza. These are "
"places Pirandello knew well, as his future wife lived near Via Duomo. Porta "
"Bibirria was built with a low vaulted arch and had the shape of an 8-meter-"
"long gallery, demolished in 1864 to create the current panoramic terrace. "
"Terravecchia, before the Chiaramontan era, included Via Duomo, Piano "
"Bibirria, and Via BacBac on the Girgenti hill. It developed from Porta dei "
"Cavalieri or 'del Pertugio' towards Porta Bibirria, descended from Via "
"BacBac, turned west towards Porta Mazzara (Via Sferri), and rose again to "
"the Church of San Giorgio. Piano Bibirria was dominated from above by the "
"Castello Vecchio, located between the San Gerlando and San Michele "
"neighborhoods, called 'u munti' for its more northern location. According to "
"tradition, the name 'Bibirria' derives from a poetic rhyming phrase "
"pronounced by San Libertino when, in 251, before being beheaded with an axe, "
"he supposedly shouted: 'Gens iniqua, plebs rea, non videbis ossa mea' "
"(unjust people, wicked plebs, you will not see my bones). However, there is "
"no document attesting to his beheading in this square, and it is highly "
"improbable that the martyred saint uttered this curse and imprecation"

"he house stood in the highest district of the city, atop the hill. Up there, "
"the city had a gate, whose Arabic name, becoming quite strange in popular "
"pronunciation: Bibirrìa, meant Gate of the Winds. Outside this gate was a "
"wide, unpaved square; and here stood the solitary house of Granella. "
"Opposite, it had only an abandoned inn, whose battered and crooked door "
"could no longer close properly, and where only occasionally did a cart "
"driver venture to spend the night guarding the cart and the mule. A single "
"oil lamp barely illuminated, on moonless nights, that unpaved square. But, a "
"stone's throw away, on this side of the gate, the district was densely "
"populated, burdened indeed with too many dwellings. So, the solitude of "
"Granella's house was not really so great, and it appeared sad (more than "
"sad, now, frightening) only at night. By day, it could be envied by all "
"those who lived in those crowded houses. Envy for its solitude, and also for "
"the house itself, not only for the freedom of the view and the air, but also "
"for the way it was built, for the comfort and amenities it offered, at a "
"much lower price than those others, which had none at all. "

"The  cathedral of Agrigento and the original Palazzo Vescovile were built "
"by  bishop Gerlando di Besançon in the 11th century to evangelize the people "
"of Muslim religion. In the following decades many problems of instability "
"were revealed because  one third of the building was built on a layer of "
"clay and landslide soil. The needed measures have almost changed completely "
"the original Norman building due to natural events, such as earthquakes, or "
"historic events, such as Muslim insurrections and  Frederick II’s wars, up "
"to the Chiaramonte dinasty, for decades lords of Agrigento, who rebuilt the "
"cathedral in its actual form. In the 15th century the tower bell was made by "
"Giovanni Montaperto bishop of Mazzara, as bulwark for the church and the "
"city.  After nine centuries of renovations, the  cathedral of Agrigento "
"shows up, today, as a Latin cross building with three aisles, with a very "
"complex architectural structure and a great variety of works of art. Also "
"the Palazzo Vescovile, seat of Vescovado and the Museo Diocesano, over the "
"centuries were extended and decorated by the bishops of the Diocesi of "
"Agrigento. Damaged by the 1693 earthquake it was quickly restored by the "
"architect Domenico Dolcemascolo that made many changes. The particular "
"entrance gate, delimited by two columns, is enriched by a triangular "
"tympanum, opened in the center, that contains the Vescovo Andrea Lucchesi "
"Palli’s emblem.  He was a man of church and a great studious devoted to "
"astronomy, history and humanities, science. He also expanded the palace and "
"was the founder of a great library in 1765. In the entrance staircase, a "
"niche contains a beautiful marble statue of Santa Maria di Monserrato.  The "
"portraits of the  bishops of Agrigento are kept inside the palace."

"CHURCH OF SAN NICOLA (THE LORD OF THE SHIP) The small church of San Nicola "
"stands on Poggio S. Nicola in the heart of the Valley of the Temples, where "
"the ancient Upper Agora was located. It offers a stunning panoramic view of "
"the Valley of the Temples and the sea. The current church constitutes the "
"southern side of the transept of a large Latin cross church that was never "
"completed and was meant to extend up to the Oratory of Phalaris. In fact, "
"the church is oriented to the south instead of the west, as was typical of "
"medieval churches. This is confirmed by the presence of chapels only on the "
"right side. In 1219, the Cistercian fathers founded the church and monastery "
"outside the city walls. In 1322, the church passed to the Benedictine monks, "
"and in 1426, Blessed Matteo Cimarra founded a Franciscan Monastery there. He "
"reconstructed the church and convent almost from scratch, incorporating "
"ruins from the nearby Temple of Jupiter, including the portal and earlier "
"chapels. In 1442, Cimarra became Bishop of Agrigento, and the Franciscan "
"convent moved to the new San Vito convent, which had previously served as "
"Agrigento’s prison. In 1567, the convent was under the direction of "
"Franciscan friar Bonoventura Sciascia, who added the lowered ogival vaults "
"and their supporting pilasters, the projecting cornice, the two outer "
"panels, and the five Renaissance semicircular arches containing five 16th-"
"century frescoes. These frescoes depict St. Sebastian and St. Roch; St. John "
"the Baptist, St. Mary of Jesus; St. Francis receiving the stigmata; and St. "
"Jerome. Below are frescoes of St. Onuphrius and St. Conrad, executed in 1575 "
"by Innocenzo Mascarella. The church, built from tuff stone, is an excellent "
"example of Gothic-Cistercian style: simple, unadorned, yet monumental. Its "
"façade is simple yet imposing, framed by two massive panels that protect the "
"beautiful pointed arch portal, crowned by a prominently projecting cornice. "
"The large wooden door was crafted by Angelo Blundo in 1531. The façade "
"retains three of the four original small white sculpted panels, in Gagini "
"style, depicting St. George or St. Michael Archangel slaying the dragon; "
"Saints Peter and Paul; and two arms clasping, symbolizing Franciscan "
"fraternity. The façade once had a bell tower, now lost. The interior is "
"austere and evocative, with a single nave surmounted by a ribbed vault. The "
"second chapel on the right once housed the famous sarcophagus of Phaedra and "
"Hippolytus, now returned to the Diocesan Museum. Goethe described it as ‘one "
"of the most graceful examples of Greek art,’ though it is actually Roman, "
"dating to the 3rd century AD. The marble sarcophagus, in excellent "
"condition, was discovered in 1740 by priest Libertino Sciascia in Porto "
"Empedocle, in the Inficherna area. On the right side are four interconnected "
"chapels, while the arches on the left side are blind. The church lacks an "
"apse and has a quadrangular shape that opens onto a square cloister. At the "
"center of the cloister is a well surrounded by a walkway, of which only the "
"east and south parts remain. Above the main altar is the ancient wooden "
"Crucifix of the ‘Lord of the Ship,’ surrounded by votive offerings. The "
"popular festival was celebrated on the first Sunday of September in honor of "
"the miraculous and highly venerated Crucifix. The rites began in the church "
"and proceeded with a procession in the space in front, where pork was "
"slaughtered, roasted, and consumed. This rural feast, which lasted until the "
"1960s, was a bustling affair, as recalled by Luigi Pirandello. The "
"churchyard filled with stalls, butcher tables, and grills for sausages and "
"pork ribs. Pigs were slaughtered on-site amidst lively noises and strong "
"smells. The religious festival, highlighted in Pirandello’s story, took on "
"the irreverent atmosphere of a pig fair and gastronomic celebration. The "
"meat was consumed on-site or at the nearby tavern ‘U Bagianu,’ accompanied "
"by wine. The Crucifix was carried in procession by fishermen and sailors to "
"the city, blessing the valley and the sea. The ‘Lord of the Ship’ is a "
"wooden Crucifix associated with a miraculous event where it is said to have "
"detached itself to save shipwrecked sailors clinging to it. In 2022, efforts "
"were made to revive the festival, emphasizing both its religious and "
"theatrical aspects. At the southeast corner of the cloister, a small door "
"leads to a group of medieval rooms connected to the church’s ancient choir, "
"now used as an auditorium. In the third room, a display case exhibits sheet "
"music and memorabilia of Agrigento musician Michele Lizzi, donated along "
"with his piano by his family to the museum. Michele Lizzi, an Agrigento "
"native, composed the symphonic poem Teano (whose ring was recently returned "
"to the Archaeological Museum) and the opera Pantea (about the widow "
"resurrected by Empedocles after 30 days). He also set Luigi Pirandello’s The "
"Lord of the Ship to music in the 1960s, premiering it at the Teatro Massimo "
"in Palermo. Faithful to the original novella, Lizzi’s work captures the "
"chaotic rural atmosphere through percussion instruments. The opera reflects "
"his childhood memories of the festival. A small park at the end of Viale "
"della Vittoria is dedicated to this distinguished musician. Near the church, "
"along the Panoramic Route of the Temples, is the roadside shrine of the "
"‘Lord of the Ship,’ commissioned by the wealthy Canon Panitteri in the early "
"19th century. The shrine is set into the wall surrounding his former "
"property. Under Panitteri’s care, the convent became a luxurious residence "
"surrounded by gardens and medicinal plants. An art lover, Panitteri welcomed "
"travelers and artists alike."

"The S. Gerlando floor, today called Piazza Don Minzoni, is located at the "
"end of Via Duomo and from which you access the staircase that leads to the "
"main façade of the Cathedral. It can be considered the oldest square in the "
"city, created to serve as a military maneuver area for the steri. "
"Overlooking the square is the majestic building of the seminary founded in "
"1577 by bishop Cesare Marullo on the remains of the ancient Steri "
"Charamontano, and the result of the interventions of several bishops "
"starting with bishop Boncontro followed by bishops Traina , Ramirez, "
"Gioieni, Lucchesi Pall who reused the medieval structures. Today it belongs "
"to the Agrigento Curia. The external façade is made up of two orders of "
"regular symmetrical windows with two baroque balconies on the portal in the "
"centre. The Steri was the fortified residence of Manfredi Chiaramonte, Grand "
"Seniscalco and Count of Modica, where he moved, leaving the previous "
"residence now the monastery of S. Spirito In 1310 Bishop Labro granted him "
"some houses where he lived he builds his palace in a strategic position. "
"Fazello tells the story that in 1353 a great celebration was held in this "
"square for the wedding of Luchina Chiaramonte, daughter of Frederick Ill, "
"whom he married Enrico Rosso, count of Aidone. In this large clearing yes he "
"prepared an extraordinary and sumptuous banquet in which the people also "
"participated. The choice of the position at the highest point of the city "
"and in particular in front of the religious symbol which was the cathedral , "
"is an expression of the prestige of the most powerful Sicilian feudal family "
"of the 14th century, of which some clear mountain testimonies remain: the "
"remains of a crenellated tower, some single-lancet windows, a double lancet "
"window and a series of cross vaults resting on pillars surmounted by "
"capitals, in which there is the Chiaramonte coat of arms where the hill and "
"the five mountains are depicted, framed by a trefoil arch. It is called 'Lo "
"steri grande' (from Hosterium , fortified palace). Adjacent to the building "
"on the north-west side of the square stood the Porta dei Cavalieri, one of "
"the nine medieval gates of the Terra Vecchia, while on the south-east side "
"there is a hidden round arch, the Arch of Spoto. The Spoto Arch represents "
"the first phase of the development of the medieval city of Terravecchia "
"before the coming of the Chiaramonte family"

msgstr "The Santa Croce district is one of the oldest areas of the Ràbato and the historic center of the city of Agrigento. Today, it is almost abandoned after the landslide of 1966. The name Ràbato comes from the Arabic RABAD (suburb outside the walls of Terravecchia). This area contrasted with the fortified district, the Hisn, where the notables and the King lived, located on the highest part of the hill dominated by the castle. The Arabic influence is clearly visible in the popular urban layout characterized by narrow alleys, courtyards, stairways, arches, catoj, winding and narrow streets, and low arches. The Arabs (Berbers from North Africa) conquered Sicily in 827 and remained there until 1096, renaming the city of Agrigentum as Kerkent. Starting from the Byzantine period, the ancient Greek city of Akragas and Roman Agrigentum, for defensive reasons, was built on the northwest side of the hill, consequently moving the port to the nearby Marina di Girgenti, accessible through the gate called Cannone, located precisely on the winding path rising between the Addolorata Church and the so-called troglodyte houses. Next to the gate, there was a circular tower functioning as a defensive system, located where the Calvario stands today. In 1864, following the lowering of Via Garibaldi and subsequent leveling, the gate was also demolished. The Arabic city rose in the Balatizzo district, discovered by Salvatore Bonfiglio in 1898, stretching between today’s Via Dante and the current Parco dell’Addolorata to the west, up to the Santa Croce district to the north, and eastward to the area where the Carmine convent was built in the 14th century. It is believed that these caves existed as early as the Protohistoric age. On the Kerkent hill, the Arabs built a castle, the remains of which are still visible, a mosque, repaired pre-existing walls, constructed watchtowers, improved communication routes, and built aqueducts, fountains, markets, civil buildings, new irrigation systems, and introduced new crops such as pistachios, carob, and citrus fruits. The Ràbato is crossed by a main street (shari) - today’s Via Garibaldi - from which many secondary alleys (zuqāq) branch off. Along the narrow, winding streets, there is an underground network of wells, channels, and filtering galleries (qanāt) that supply water to the entire city, the result of a skilled irrigation exploitation of the area’s spring and underground waters. In the Balatizzo district, people lived in stone shelters, called grubi. These are caves carved into the shelly tuff rock, used not only as dwellings but also as warehouses, cellars, and stables. These rock shelters are safe, hidden, economical, and long-lasting. Numerous bell-shaped cisterns carved into the rock have been found, likely used for collecting rainwater. Some of these cisterns were transformed into crypts during the construction of the Addolorata Church. They are located under the churchyard and the nave, and some are still accessible today. In one of these cisterns, human bone remains were allegedly found, as until the 19th century, a cemetery stood next to the current churchyard. These rock-cut dwellings were used until the 1950s by poor people, as evidenced by plaster and masonry remains inside some of them. The Ràbato is a poor and popular district inhabited by farmers, breeders, and small artisans, whose homes often consisted of a ground floor room with a mezzanine for the bedroom, adjacent to the stable. The entrance faced a courtyard where women and children spent most of their daily lives. Even in periods after the Arabic era, the district continued to be populated, dedicated to agriculture and craftsmanship, a hub of commerce and religious and popular traditions, animated by artisan workshops and street vendors. The landslide on July 19, 1966, caused by the cementification of the area starting from the post-war period, water infiltration from the Drago River into the clayey subsoil between the two hills of Agrigento and Montaperto, and massive tuff quarries, led to the abandonment of the heavily damaged Ràbato. Some timid urban redevelopment interventions can be observed, such as the establishment of B&Bs and the Parco dell’Addolorata, known as Parco Icori, unfortunately also in a state of decay."

Nearby, he had an old small house, where he would close his eyes forever: He had enriched himself in a short time with usury, and now he lorded over, sitting under the Madonna's lamp, behind the long counter of his bakery shop, which was the largest on the whole Via Atenèa. Mrs. Nela, with a face like an eggplant planted without a neck atop enormous breasts, did not speak until she first consulted with her husband's eyes. But to one of the daughters, turning her gaze to the ledge nearby, where the two ancient Temples rise, one of Juno on one side and the other called the Temple of Concord on the other, in a burst of admiration sprang right from the heart: ●	Oh beautiful, daddy! Instead of going through the Ponte Gate, he preferred to take the Solitary Street under Saint Peter up to the Ravanusella Plain; even though that street was infamous for many crimes that remained obscure and, to pass through it late at night, instilled a certain dread. Footsteps echoed there, because the slope of the hill was so steep that the walls of the houses almost abutted there. Houses that, on the front, on the little street above, were only one story and of a miserable appearance, but here in the back they had walls that seemed like those of a cathedral. On the other side, at the beginning, the street still showed the ancient city wall with its half-ruined towers. In the first one, barely closed by a faded and crooked partition, unknown dead were displayed, and the slain were brought there for judicial inspections. Crossing that stretch, Maràbito really felt, in the silence and amidst the echo of footsteps, like there was something mysterious in that street; and he couldn't wait to arrive at the Ravanusella Plain, airy. But he only breathed easy there for a short while. He had to go back up towards the Santa Lucia Strait, also notorious and almost always deserted, to reach the Mazzata Gate, where he entered the Ràbato Street. Used to living in the countryside, entering the narrowness of the houses, he felt suffocated every time, even if he crossed the city through the main street, which he didn't call by its name - Via Atenèa - but in the manner of everyone (and who knows why) the Small Square: it was not a square at all; it was a street a bit wider and longer than the others, winding, paved, with elegant houses and shops in a row. How much noise did Maràbito's clogged boots make on those smooth slippery stones as he walked hunched over and cautious, with the gait of peasants, hands behind his back and looking down, while the black cap's tassel dangled on his neck with each step. Everything stirred up, seeing from afar, on the right, Scinè's bakery shop with its four grand opulent windows and the door in the middle. It was right in the center of the street just before the Largo dei Tribunali, where people crowded the most."

"The Viale della Vittoria, once a public promenade, was built in 1848 under "
"the Bourbon domination, starting the excavation of the calcarenite bank "
"south of the “Rupe Atenea”, starting from Piazza G. Marconi, corresponding "
"to the apsidal part of the Church of San Calogero and reaching the "
"hemicycle, which will become Piazza Cavour. This area was occupied by "
"prickly pear plants and almond trees, and above the straight stretch near "
"the church of San Calogero, there was built, facing the sea, a sandstone "
"seat, about fifteen meters long, on which you can climb with six steps. "
"There existed on the site itself, where Villa Picone is today, a small "
"botanical garden of herbs and medicinal plants, surrounded by walls. In the "
"lower part, in  the south part of the road, you could see the church and the "
"Capuchin convent, transformed into a military district in 1872, with the "
"extended forest enclosed in a wall, and surrounded inside by large cypress "
"trees, a few meters away from each other. When  in 1871 the municipality "
"purchased the land to the east, the name became “Passeggiata della Libertà”. "
"In 1873 the southern supporting wall was rebuilt in regular blocks  "
"interspersed with vertical elements that form the structural frame, its top "
"ending in a gorge. White marble columns were placed above it, connected by "
"geometrically designed railings, with a vase above. In 1882 new extensions "
"were made and the Passeggiata della Libertà became Passeggiata Cavour , in "
"whose square evening concerts were held, concerts of symphonic music with "
"the maestros Lauria and Lizzi, after whom the villa at the end of the avenue "
"was named. In the 1920s  a villa was built in that area in memory of the "
"fallen of the First World War which took the name of Parco della "
"Rimembranza, today Villa Bonfiglio, at the center of which the War Memorial "
"was placed, commissioned by Palermo sculptor Mario Rutelli. In the initial "
"part of the Avenue, at the highest point compared to the road level, the "
"Grand hotel et Agrigentum was built by the Altieri family, whose view of the "
"Valley of the Temples and the coast, which from Punta Bianca reaches up to "
"Monte Rossello, made it highly sought after, so much  that it was soon "
"frequented by wealthy people, political personalities of the time and the "
"top fascist hierarchs who held receptions, conferences and cultural meetings "
"there. In the 1930s the world crisis hit and the noble tourism that "
"frequented Agrigento disappeared in a very short time. The Hotel Agrigentum "
"made a loss, the partners quarreled and the hotel was closed. After the 2nd "
"World War it became the seat of the Finance Authority and a floor was added "
"to the building. On  February 12th 1927, it was definitively called Viale "
"della Vittoria to commemorate the success of the Italian army in the 1st "
"World War. The hemicycle will remain named after Cavour. In 1930 there will "
"begin works  for  the construction of residential buildings in the Cavour "
"hemicycle which will change the layout from semicircular to rectangular, on "
"25th of  October of the same year,  the psychiatric hospital will be "
"inaugurated . On 28th of  October 1935 the new premises of the elementary "
"schools of the Lauricella complex were inaugurated and,  on the same day,  "
"the Post Office building was inaugurated."

#~ "The  cathedral of Agrigento and the original Palazzo Vescovile were built "

#~ " The 'Granella House,' or more accurately Palazzo Quartana, takes its "

#~ "in his novella; austere and solitary, not only because of its location "
#~ "but also due to the fact that Quartana's wife was thrown out of the house "
#~ "after being discovered as the lover of Nicolò Gallo. This episode "
#~ "inspired Luigi Pirandello to write 'L’esclusa.' Even today, the shutters "
#~ "are always closed and it remains uninhabited, except for about 40 years "
#~ "ago when it was used as an elementary school (it is said that the school "
#~ "had a short life due to ghosts! This explains why it is still uninhabited "
#~ "today). The literary description in the novella is a felicitous portrayal "
#~ "of the house, the square, and the neighborhood from a geographical and "
#~ "sociological perspective. The house was built at the highest and most "
#~ "solitary point, outside Porta Bibirria. The facade is characterized by "
#~ "beautiful arches, more or less visible within the frame of the ground "
#~ "floor commercial activities. There is also a liturgical center selling "

#~ "Dionisio Sciascia, the architect of the theaters in Agrigento and "
#~ "Racalmuto, is simple. In front of the 'Granella House' is now the "
#~ "'Belvedere Don Bosco,' from where one can admire the Agrigento hinterland "
#~ "from Raffadali to Cammarata. From Piazza Bibirria, heading west, you "
#~ "reach Via Duomo with the Cathedral, the Seminary, the Curia, the Bishop's "
#~ "Palace, and the Diocesan Museum. To the south, Via BacBac (the dwarf's "
#~ "street) leads to Piano Lena and Piazza della Riconoscenza. These are "
#~ "places Pirandello knew well, as his future wife lived near Via Duomo. "
#~ "Porta Bibirria was built with a low vaulted arch and had the shape of an "
#~ "8-meter-long gallery, demolished in 1864 to create the current panoramic "
#~ "terrace. Terravecchia, before the Chiaramontan era, included Via Duomo, "
#~ "Piano Bibirria, and Via BacBac on the Girgenti hill. It developed from "
#~ "Porta dei Cavalieri or 'del Pertugio' towards Porta Bibirria, descended "
#~ "from Via BacBac, turned west towards Porta Mazzara (Via Sferri), and rose "
#~ "again to the Church of San Giorgio. Piano Bibirria was dominated from "
#~ "above by the Castello Vecchio, located between the San Gerlando and San "
#~ "Michele neighborhoods, called 'u munti' for its more northern location. "
#~ "According to tradition, the name 'Bibirria' derives from a poetic rhyming "

#~ "with an axe, he supposedly shouted: 'Gens iniqua, plebs rea, non videbis "
#~ "ossa mea' (unjust people, wicked plebs, you will not see my bones). "
