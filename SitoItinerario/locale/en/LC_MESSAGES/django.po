msgstr "The Basilica dell'Immacolata, identified as the Church of San Francesco d'Assisi, with the adjoining Convent, was founded by the Franciscan Friars Minor who had settled in Sicily in the 13th century and, particularly in Agrigento, since 1295. The plan of the Church is rectangular, with a single nave without transept, with seven side altars; The walls and the ceiling were frescoed by the painter Lucio Gurreri, who depicted, on the vault of the apse, among the saints, in a crowded heavenly image, the figures of Mons. Michele Sclafani and Bishop Mons. Giovanni Battista Peruzzo, who wanted to be buried in the same church. The first construction is of Chiaramonte origin, as confirmed by the testament of Donna Isabella Chiaramonte of December 6, 1362, in which she ordered her heirs to erect a tomb for her, upon her death, in that 'Tribuna nova ecclesiae conventus San Francisci', built by Federico Chiaramonte. In 1788, a new bell tower was added, and after the bombings of 1943, Mons. Michele Sclafani, rector of the Basilica, promptly intervened to restore the monument, both externally and internally, by reproducing the paintings and decorations. A plaque on the perimeter wall recalls that on July 12, 1943, an Allied bomber hit the shelter in Via San Francesco, causing 340 victims. The basilica today is in excellent condition with its magnificent facade in sandstone tuff, flanked by two bell towers. In the center at the bottom is an elegant portal between Ionic pilasters and Gothic and local decorative elements, precisely Chiaramonte, while at the top is the niche containing the statue of Saint Francis, in white marble."

msgstr "The statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, kept all year within a wall closet in the sacristy of the church of St. Francis of Assisi, on the eighth day of December, all adorned with gold and gems, with the azure mantle of silk starred with silver, after the solemn church services, was borne on the litter in procession through the steep streets of Montelusa, amidst the old cracked hovels, pressed, almost one upon the other; up, up, until reaching the Cathedral atop the hill; and there left, in the evening, as a guest of the patron Saint Gerlando. In the Cathedral, the Blessed Virgin Mary was to remain from Thursday evening until Sunday morning: two and a half days. But now, out of habit, seeming too short this time, it was left for that first Sunday after the feast, and the following Sunday was awaited to bring her back with a new and more pompous procession to the church of St. Francis."

msgstr "The  cathedral of Agrigento and the original Palazzo Vescovile were built by  bishop Gerlando di Besançon in the 11th century to evangelize the people of Muslim religion. In the following decades many problems of instability were revealed because  one third of the building was built on a layer of clay and landslide soil. The needed measures have almost changed completely the original Norman building due to natural events, such as earthquakes, or historic events, such as Muslim insurrections and  Frederick II’s wars, up to the Chiaramonte dinasty, for decades lords of Agrigento, who rebuilt the cathedral in its actual form. In the 15th century the tower bell was made by Giovanni Montaperto bishop of Mazzara, as bulwark for the church and the city.  After nine centuries of renovations, the  cathedral of Agrigento shows up, today, as a Latin cross building with three aisles, with a very complex architectural structure and a great variety of works of art. Also the Palazzo Vescovile, seat of Vescovado and the Museo Diocesano, over the centuries were extended and decorated by the bishops of the Diocesi of Agrigento. Damaged by the 1693 earthquake it was quickly restored by the architect Domenico Dolcemascolo that made many changes. The particular entrance gate, delimited by two columns, is enriched by a triangular tympanum, opened in the center, that contains the Vescovo Andrea Lucchesi Palli’s emblem.  He was a man of church and a great studious devoted to astronomy, history and humanities, science. He also expanded the palace and was the founder of a great library in 1765. In the entrance staircase, a niche contains a beautiful marble statue of Santa Maria di Monserrato.  The portraits of the  bishops of Agrigento are kept inside the palace."

msgstr "The S. Gerlando floor, today called Piazza Don Minzoni, is located at the end of Via Duomo and from which you access the staircase that leads to the main façade of the Cathedral. It can be considered the oldest square in the city, created to serve as a military maneuver area for the steri. Overlooking the square is the majestic building of the seminary founded in 1577 by bishop Cesare Marullo on the remains of the ancient Steri Charamontano, and the result of the interventions of several bishops starting with bishop Boncontro followed by bishops Traina , Ramirez, Gioieni, Lucchesi Pall who reused the medieval structures. Today it belongs to the Agrigento Curia. The external façade is made up of two orders of regular symmetrical windows with two baroque balconies on the portal in the centre. The Steri was the fortified residence of Manfredi Chiaramonte, Grand Seniscalco and Count of Modica, where he moved, leaving the previous residence now the monastery of S. Spirito In 1310 Bishop Labro granted him some houses where he lived he builds his palace in a strategic position. Fazello tells the story that in 1353 a great celebration was held in this square for the wedding of Luchina Chiaramonte, daughter of Frederick Ill, whom he married Enrico Rosso, count of Aidone. In this large clearing yes he prepared an extraordinary and sumptuous banquet in which the people also participated. The choice of the position at the highest point of the city and in particular in front of the religious symbol which was the cathedral , is an expression of the prestige of the most powerful Sicilian feudal family of the 14th century, of which some clear mountain testimonies remain: the remains of a crenellated tower, some single-lancet windows, a double lancet window and a series of cross vaults resting on pillars surmounted by capitals, in which there is the Chiaramonte coat of arms where the hill and the five mountains are depicted, framed by a trefoil arch. It is called 'Lo steri grande' (from Hosterium , fortified palace). Adjacent to the building on the north-west side of the square stood the Porta dei Cavalieri, one of the nine medieval gates of the Terra Vecchia, while on the south-east side there is a hidden round arch, the Arch of Spoto. The Spoto Arch represents the first phase of the development of the medieval city of Terravecchia before the coming of the Chiaramonte family"

A few hours earlier, his wife had been caught red-handed in adultery with the knight Don Agatino Fiorìca."

msgstr "His favorite activity was going on the balcony and shooting with a sling the birds on the tower bell of San Pietro Church. The building was then blew up during  World War II, and everything  was destroyed. After the war, the building was completely restored and today it hosts a medical studio. The young writer wasn’t born in this house as his mother, scared of the cholera epidemics, had decided to move out of Agrigento to their  country house in a rural area called Caos. When the cholera emergency ended, Pirandello’s family returned to the city house. He was so attached to his house that he describes it in many stories."

msgstr "The Viale della Vittoria, once a public promenade, was built in 1848 under the Bourbon domination, starting the excavation of the calcarenite bank south of the “Rupe Atenea”, starting from Piazza G. Marconi, corresponding to the apsidal part of the Church of San Calogero and reaching the hemicycle, which will become Piazza Cavour. This area was occupied by prickly pear plants and almond trees, and above the straight stretch near the church of San Calogero, there was built, facing the sea, a sandstone seat, about fifteen meters long, on which you can climb with six steps. There existed on the site itself, where Villa Picone is today, a small botanical garden of herbs and medicinal plants, surrounded by walls. In the lower part, in  the south part of the road, you could see the church and the Capuchin convent, transformed into a military district in 1872, with the extended forest enclosed in a wall, and surrounded inside by large cypress trees, a few meters away from each other. When  in 1871 the municipality purchased the land to the east, the name became “Passeggiata della Libertà”. In 1873 the southern supporting wall was rebuilt in regular blocks  interspersed with vertical elements that form the structural frame, its top ending in a gorge. White marble columns were placed above it, connected by geometrically designed railings, with a vase above. In 1882 new extensions were made and the Passeggiata della Libertà became Passeggiata Cavour , in whose square evening concerts were held, concerts of symphonic music with the maestros Lauria and Lizzi, after whom the villa at the end of the avenue was named. In the 1920s  a villa was built in that area in memory of the fallen of the First World War which took the name of Parco della Rimembranza, today Villa Bonfiglio, at the center of which the War Memorial was placed, commissioned by Palermo sculptor Mario Rutelli. In the initial part of the Avenue, at the highest point compared to the road level, the Grand hotel et Agrigentum was built by the Altieri family, whose view of the Valley of the Temples and the coast, which from Punta Bianca reaches up to Monte Rossello, made it highly sought after, so much  that it was soon frequented by wealthy people, political personalities of the time and the top fascist hierarchs who held receptions, conferences and cultural meetings there. In the 1930s the world crisis hit and the noble tourism that frequented Agrigento disappeared in a very short time. The Hotel Agrigentum made a loss, the partners quarreled and the hotel was closed. After the 2nd World War it became the seat of the Finance Authority and a floor was added to the building. On  February 12th 1927, it was definitively called Viale della Vittoria to commemorate the success of the Italian army in the 1st World War. The hemicycle will remain named after Cavour. In 1930 there will begin works  for  the construction of residential buildings in the Cavour hemicycle which will change the layout from semicircular to rectangular, on 25th of  October of the same year,  the psychiatric hospital will be inaugurated . On 28th of  October 1935 the new premises of the elementary schools of the Lauricella complex were inaugurated and,  on the same day,  the Post Office building was inaugurated."

msgstr "They knew each other so deeply that a slight nod, a glance, a word sufficed for one to immediately understand the other's thoughts. Thus, their walk always began with a brief exchange of phrases and then continued in silence, as if one had given the other something to ponder for a while. And they walked with their heads down, like two tired horses; both with their hands behind their backs. Neither of them ever felt tempted to turn their heads towards the railing of the avenue to enjoy the view of the open countryside below, varied with hills and valleys and plains, with the sea in the background, all ablaze in the last fires of the sunset: a view of such beauty that it seemed almost unbelievable that those two could pass by without even turning to look."
